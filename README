About nxAM:

From the AM Radio to the Body by the Psyche.

Consciousness creates patterns from chaos. She orders the reality to live. My algorithms extract information from the noise of the radio and transform, create patterns, melodies, colorful figures... I model these structures by altering the code (livecoding), improvising a physical journey to consciousness.
